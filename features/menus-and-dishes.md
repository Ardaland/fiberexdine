# Menus & Dishes

The CloudWaitress menu system allows you to create highly customizable menus and dishes with ease.

## **Menus**

These represent your actual real-life menus. Many stores have just one main menu that's always available while others may have a lunch & dinner menu or a pickup only menu. You will need at least one menu for your online store to work.

Menu availability can depend on certain conditions such as order types \(pickups or deliveries\), order timings \(e.g. pre-order only\). They can also be restricted to certain days and timings.

## **Categories**

Categories represent a sub-section of a menu and consist of dishes. For example, if you have one standard menu, your categories might include, starters, mains, sides, drinks and deserts.

Categories can also be shared between menus, for example, if you have a common list of drinks, that category can be included in any menu to save time re-creating it.

If you have a very large category that really requires more sub-sections, such as large amount of burgers stored into chicken burgers, beef burgers, etc... consider creating a 'Burger' menu instead of a 'Burger' category. Then all your burger types will be categories.

## **Dishes**

These represent actual items that can be purchased. Dishes must be added to a category and can only exist in a single category. There are 2 types of dishes.

### Standard Dishes

A standard dish which works as you would expect. You would use it to create items such as 'Steak w/ fries and salad' or 'Beer' etc.

### Combo Dishes

This allows you to create a list of dishes for customers to choose between. For example these can be used to create combos or deals such as '3 Pizzas + Drink' which would allow the customers to select 3 different pizzas and a drink. To do this you will first need to create all your pizzas and your drinks as standard dishes. Then when creating your combo, you can create 3 choices that include all the pizzas and one choice that includes all the drinks.

## **Option Sets**

These represent various additional options for a dish and allow for added customization. Option sets can be shared between many different dishes and are very comprehensive in functionality. Examples of what can be done include creating an optional list of sauces, allowing customers to choose their type of meat, a list of additional pizza ingredients, create your own type dishes and much much more.

Option sets have many configurable settings such as a free amount, making it required to select a certain amount of options, charging additional fees for options and much more.

## **Dish Availability & Statuses**

Currently we have a basic system to help you manage dish availability on a per-location basis. You can easily manage the status of dishes by selecting the status option from the action dropdown for a dish in the "Menu &gt; Dishes" page of the admin dashboard.

Under the dish status menu, you can set the status of a dish to hidden, no-stock or not available.

Hidden dishes will not appear in your menu. Dishes out of stock or not available will display their respective tags and will be inaccessible when ordering.
