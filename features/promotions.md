# Promotions

Promotions are discount codes that you can create and distribute that provide either a fixed a percent based discount on a customers order. Promotion codes only apply to a customers cart total, not their order total which includes taxes \(unless your price is tax inclusive\) and other fees.

Promotions can be created under the "Promotions" menu in the admin interface.

## **How Promotions Work**

Once you create a promotion and a code for it, you can provide it to your customers. Customers can then add this promotion to their cart before checking out as shown below.

**Promotion Type & Value**

You can create promotions that either provide a fixed value discount, e.g. $5 off. You can also create promotions that provide a percent based discount, e.g. 25% off.
