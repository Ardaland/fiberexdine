# Table Bookings

Table bookings is an exciting feature that allows you to accept online bookings requests. It also helps inform your customer about the status of their booking.

## **How Table Bookings Work**

A table booking request can be initiated by your customer through your online store. Once the customer fills out the details, they will receive an e-mail containing all the details of their request.

You will also get an e-mail notification regarding the booking and you can view all the details under the "Bookings" page in the admin dashboard.

In the admin page, you can confirm or cancel bookings. The first time you either confirm or cancel a booking, your customer will receive an e-mail informing them of the change in status.

If you confirm a booking, make sure you are prepared on the day by reserving a table for your customer.

## **Booking Settings**

Access your table booking settings under the "Settings &gt; Order Types &gt; Table Booking" page in the admin dashboard. There you will find the following settings.
