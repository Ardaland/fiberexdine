# Getting Started

Before getting started, it's important to understand that the process of setting up an online ordering system for your business involves many moving parts. It requires a certain level of commitment to set up and implement into your business. However the benefits it brings greatly outweigh the time it takes to set up such a system. The most time consuming aspect of the process is adding all your menus. If your menu is simple, the set up process is much faster.

One of the goals of our system is to make this entire setup process as smooth as possible. We highly encourage you to reach out to us if you need help with any aspect of the setup process as we will be able to clear any doubts and guide you through the process easily.

### Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create an account by using the "Register" button at the top or bottom menu. Every account comes with a free trial period for you to test. We also have our free plan that allows you to get a website with the online ordering disabled. Upon registering, you will be taken to the restaurant setup page where you can enter your basic restaurant details. Here you will be able to set some of your basic settings including your

* Store name and slogan
* Website subdomain
* Currency, taxes, locale
* An initial store location
* Opening hours
* Types of orders you will accept

Once complete you will be taken to your restaurant dashboard. This is your main admin interface where you can modify all the settings related to your online store. It is also where you will be able to receive and manage online orders.
