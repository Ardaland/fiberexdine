# Hardware Requirements

Requirements

### Stable Internet Connection

Every aspect of the system runs online and therefore requires you to be connected to the internet to receive orders. Here are a few recommendations about how to setup your internet:

* Use your own internet connection instead of a shared connection so you have greater control
* Keep a 3G / 4G mobile internet connection as a backup in-case there is an interruption with your wired connection. Consider using your phone on hotspot mode for such instances.
* Consider exclusively using a 3G / 4G mobile internet connection. Certain countries have a much more reliable mobile network such as Australia.

### Computer / Tablet / Mobile

To manage your online store and orders, you will need a device that can access a web browser. This can be anything from a phone to a desktop PC. Ideally we recommend using a tablet or bigger device so that you can manage orders better.

### Printer

You can automatically or manually print new orders using **any printer whose drivers are installed on a Windows or Linux PC**. To clarify, this means if you can print to your printer from an application like Word or Notepad, then it's compatible with our service. We highly recommend using a **thermal receipt printer** over a standard printer.

**Supported Windows Versions: 7 / 8 / 10**

## Recommended Tablets

We highly recommend using a **Windows 10 tablet** as this will provide the greatest flexibility and allow for wireless order printing if setup correctly

### Worldwide

Nearly every company offers a Windows 10 tablet these days and you can't go wrong choosing from one of the major brands. Some notable brands include:

* **Lenevo** - Multiple products
* **ASUS** - Multiple products
* **HP** - Multiple products
* **Microsoft** - Surface Pro Tablet
* **Chuwi** - Decent Chinese brand [available online](https://www.aliexpress.com/af/chuwi-windows-10.html?SearchText=chuwi+windows+10&d=y&blanktest=0&initiative_id=SB_20180714192003&origin=n&catId=0&isViewCP=y&jump=afs), starting from around $200

### Australia

If you are based in Australia, consider the following budget friendly Kogan branded devices.

* [Kogan Windows 10 Tablet](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/kogan-atlas-2-1-d500-pro-touchscreen-notebook/) - $299 AUD
* [Kogan Windows 10 Mini PC](https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/kogan-atlas-c300-mini-pc/) - $219 AUD

## Recommend Printers

You can use any printer with Windows or Linux drivers so you are not restricted to just the printers we recommend.

### Branded Printers

Organised from lowest to highest price.

* Epson TM-T20 - Available with USB or Ethernet
* Epson TM-M30 - Bluetooth
* Epson TM-T82-II-i - USB and Ethernet, supporting many connected devices
* Star Micronics TSP143 - Available as Bluetooth or USB or WIFI

### Unbranded Printers

If you are on a budget, consider buying a thermal printer direct from China through a site like [www.aliexpress.com](https://www.aliexpress.com/af/80mm-thermal-printer.html?SearchText=80mm+thermal+printer&d=y&blanktest=0&initiative_id=SB_20180714191307&origin=n&catId=0&isViewCP=y&jump=afs). Searching **80mm thermal printer** will show many results and you can often find printers under a $100 with built-in WIFI, Bluetooth, USB and Ethernet all in one. All those printers also have Windows compatible printer drivers as well.

We have many clients using these unbranded printers without any issues.
