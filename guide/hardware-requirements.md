# Hardware Requirements

To get the most from CloudWaitress, it is important that you have the correct in-store setup to receive and manage orders.

There are several different configurations available depending on your business requirements. You will need the following things:

1. Stable internet connection \(Required\)
2. Mobile device or computer \(Required\)
3. Printer \(Optional, requires Windows PC\)

## **Stable Internet Connection**

CloudWaitress requires that your devices are connected to the internet to receive orders. It is highly recommended that you have your own internet connection for your store so you have control over its reliability and security. We also recommend that you have either 3G or 4G mobile internet on standby in case your local internet line experiences service interruptions.

## **Computer or Mobile Device**

To receive and manage orders we personally recommend using a **Windows tablet** over other mobile devices. Computers have the best performance and greatest compatibility with our software but even tablets work perfectly.

The added advantage of using a Windows tablet computer as your primary device to receive and manage orders is that it will be able to connect with your printer to receive orders automatically.

Please note, that our printing software is only compatible with Windows 7, 8 & 10. It is not comaptible with Windows RT editions.

Recommended Windows Tablet

Right now Windows tablets are becoming popular and it's not hard to find a good one for around the $200-$400 range. Some notable brands include Lenevo, Asus, Huawei, Chuwi etc. These brands are reliable and very affordable. Lenevo & Asus can generally be purchased from local retailers. Other brands can be found on large retailers like Amazon & Ali Express.

The other option is using a stick PC's which is relatively new. They are a computer packed into a stick smaller than your hand. These can easily be plugged into any monitor via HDMI. Check out Intel's compute stick at [http://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/compute-stick/intel-compute-stick.html](http://www.intel.com.au/content/www/au/en/compute-stick/intel-compute-stick.html). These start around $150 but you will also need to purchase either a touch screen monitor or a regular monitor with a keyboard and mouse. The added advantage of this is the great portability.

### Recommended Tablet

If you would rather use a tablet, we recommend an Android over an Apple because of its compatibility with web notifications which unfortunately mobile Apple devices do not support at the time of writing this. We do not have a specific Android device that we recommend due to the large range available. That said we've had good experiences using Asus & Google tablets. Any basic tablet will be sufficient.

## **Printer**

Printing orders require you to use a separate application that can be installed on a Windows PC. Any printers connected and installed on that computer will then be picked up by the application and made available on your restaurant management dashboard.

You can print orders directly from your online order management interface but the printer MUST be connected to a Windows PC with an internet connection and the printing software and printer drivers installed.

The orders are printed in receipt format so it's best to use a thermal receipt printer due to the small paper size, fast printing speed and small printer size. Thermal printers start at $50 and go well beyond $1000 depending on the features you require.

### **Recommended Printer**

We tested the printing on the standard "POS-8220" Chinese generic thermal printers without any issues arising. These printers start at $100 and are probably the cheapest available. They can easily be found on google, ebay or ali express by searching "POS-8220".
