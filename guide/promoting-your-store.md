# Promoting Your Store

Once you have setup your online store settings and menus, you are ready to start taking orders. Getting online orders requires you to drive customers to your website to place orders. This means promoting your new website, the same as any other website, e-commerce store or online business.

Some element of that is integrated as part of our system but there is still much that is beyond our software. This single page does not do justice to the vast number of strategies available to you. The below suggestions are here to help you get started. Even after doing these, you should never stop trying to figure out how to market your online store better.

## **Let Your Customers Know**

Initially, your customers will not be aware of your new online ordering system. It's important that you let them know this exists. This can be done by handing out cards or flyers. You can also put up a small leaflet on your counter. You can inform customers who call in to make an order that they can now order online. This is really about getting creative and communicating the message to your customers.

## **Promote Through Social Media**

Spread the word through your facebook page, twitter account or any other social channel which you connect with your customers. Consider our facebook page integration to allow customers to order directly through Facebook.

## **Setup A Custom Domain Name**

By default, your online store can be found on a sub-domain of "[cloudwaitress.com.](http://cloudwaitress.com/) It is essential that you set this subdomain to be something that customers can easily remember and is in line with your business as this is the link your customers will need to visit to find your website.

While the subdomain is just there to get you up and running quickly, it's best to purchase your own domain name for your business. You can then configure your store to your own custom domain name. Having a domain customers can easily remember or bookmark means they can access your site easily. If you need a domain, we recommend reading our setting up a custom domain support article. If you already have one, start the process by submitting a custom domain request under the "Settings &gt; Domains" menu in your admin dashboard

## **Basic SEO Settings**

SEO which stands for search engine optimization is the process of making your site discoverable and rank high on search engines such as Google. There are some basic and simple things you can do to ensure you that you rank high on search engines so customers can find you online and order directly.

### **Set Page Title & Meta**

Under the "Settings &gt; Seo" menu, you can edit your website title and meta tag. These tags are what your google search listing will consist of. It is recommended that you set these to something extremely local. Say you own an Indian restaurant called the Red Turban in a suburb called Townsville in New York. Your title should be "Red Turban - Authentic Indian Townsville New York. Your meta should just expand on that more but make sure to hit on your keywords which are your locality and cuisine. The reason for this is because locality will reduce the massive competition and noise of other websites on search engines and it is most likely what customers will be searching for in your local area.

### **Submit Your Website To Google, Bing etc**

You should submit your link to search engines, for google and bing u can do so here. [https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url) and [http://www.bing.com/toolbox/submit-site-url](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/submit-site-url)

### **Create A Google Places Listing**

A Google places listing will allow local customers to find you far easier as its focused on your locality. This means you are more likely to rank high if the person searching for you is near your store. Follow this link [https://www.google.com.au/business/](https://www.google.com.au/business/) to create or manage your listing.

**Do not forget to add an "Placing an order" link to your places listing**

### **Paid Advertising**

You can consider paying for facebook or google marketing. Both of these are avenues to generate new customers. How to do this is out of the scope of our documentation but there are plenty of good guides for that online.

## **Get Creative**

When it comes to marketing the sky is the limit, which can also be a problem because it can be hard to figure out what to do or what works. To truly succeed, you must get creative and learn about the best ways to get in touch with your customers and share your message with them. To get you started, some other ideas include e-mail marketing and free samples.

### **Need Images Or Posters?**

Marketing your store requires you often have a few nice images to put up on social channels or posters to print out for in-store. We recommend using a tool such as [https://www.canva.com/](https://www.canva.com/).
