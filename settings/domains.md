# Domains

Your domain settings can be found in the "Settings &gt; Domains" page under the admin interface.

## **What Is A Domain?**

A domain is any web address, for example, 'google.com' is a domain.

### **Your Sub-domain**

Your store will be accessible on your own unique subdomain that you can choose. Your subdomain will always be hosted under "\(example\).cloudwaitress.com". Every subdomain must be unique and is taken on a first come first serve basis.

### **Custom Domains**

A custom domain is a domain name you purchase and connect to our service. You can register any domain name available such as "yourbusiness.com" and connect it to our service. This way customers can go directly your domain name to find your online ordering system.

It is often desirable to have your own domain name for your store in order to better promote your own brand and business. It is much easier to tell your customers to find you at "yourbusiness.com" instead of "yourbusiness.cloudwaitress.com".

## **Setting Up A Custom Domain**

We have made this process as easy as possible for you to setup. If you don't have a domain name, we highly recommend reading our article at [https://www.cloudwaitress.com/support/guide/setting-up-a-custom-domain-name](https://www.cloudwaitress.com/support/guide/setting-up-a-custom-domain-name)

### **Change DNS Settings To Point To Us**

To make your online store accessible on your domain, you will need to access your Domain Name Server \(DNS\) settings and set a custom CNAME record. The record must point to the value "stores.cloudwaitress.com". To learn how to do this with Namecheap you can read their guide [here](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9646/2237/how-can-i-set-up-a-cname-record-for-my-domain).

Nearly every domain provider has a guide on how to set a CNAME record or other domain records. If you have your own domain elsewhere, please see if they have a guide or contact their support.

### **Set Your Domain Name**

Once you have completed this, head to the domain settings page, enter your domain name and send us a custom domain request. We will process this within 24 hours and your domain will be active with your own SSL from Let's Encrypt.

### **SSL Certificates**

An SSL certificate is used to identify a secure connection between a user and your website along with providing data encryption. This is required for extra security and tasks such as online payment processing. Search engines also treat sites using SSL certificates better. Normally setting up an SSL can be difficult and generally cost additional money. With CloudWaitress, we use Let's Encrypt to generate your own fully valid SSL certificates for your custom domain at no cost. All this is handled automatically when you set up your domain with us. All our subdomains are covered under our domain wildcard SSL.
