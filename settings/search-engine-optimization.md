# Search Engine Optimization

Your search engine optimization \(SEO\) settings can be found under the "Settings &gt; SEO" page in the admin interface.

## **What Is SEO?**

Search engine optimization is the process of making your website more discoverable by search engines. This is useful to generate organic traffic which can lead to increased sales. It also helps customers who are relevant to you find your website. SEO is affected by many different factors, some of which are out of your control. Out of what can be controlled, your Title and Meta Description have some weight on what customers find when they search through Google.

## **SEO Settings**

Under the SEO settings page, you can modify your store Title & Meta tags. These tags are what will show up under your search engine listings. The title is your main page title and the description is the text below it. You can see a preview of this using this [tool](https://www.portent.com/serp-preview-tool). It is highly recommended that you pick keywords that are local and relevant to your business.

For example, if you are running a Chinese restaurant at Melbourne City, then your title tag for your page might be "Order Online - Delicious Chinese Food, Melbourne City". Your meta description might be "Taste our wonderful authentic Chinese cuisine. Order online and collect in store at xyz street Melbourne, Australia".

With these kinds of settings, if someone searches up 'Chinese food Melbourne', you are much more likely to rank higher up and people are likely to click through because of your enticing description.

It is highly recommended that you check out the [keyword planner tool](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner). This allows you to see what kinds of keywords are being searched at what location with the number of people searching them. The tool might be a bit confusing to use initially but there are plenty of guides and tutorials available online. This kind of information is invaluable in selecting correct page titles in order to generate the most organic online traffic.
